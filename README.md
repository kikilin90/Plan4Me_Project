#The Story Behind PlanHacker

Hi, I am Kimberly Lin aka Kiki. I am currently attending Hackbright Academy in San Francisco, CA and this is my Hackbright project. The story behind my project, called PlanHacker, is based on my college experiences. In college, it can be overwhelming to manage your time for a lot of homework, preps for exams or quizzes, projects that involves team collaborations, and of course hanging out with your friends. Sometimes, I have a to-do list handy in my pocket to keep track of what I need to do. Sometimes, I put things down in my calendar for meet-ups and important events. However, I regrettably forget to put down everything in the right places, so they are no longer in sync. While at Hackbright, I really want to create a simple, yet powerful web app that is really beneficial and usable. Because I am a problem solver and planning has been a pain in the butt for me, I decided to take my problem and turn it into a project, in which I coded into life... everything that I look for in a planner... my dream planner. Hence, my PlanHacker.

#My Vision with PlanHacker

I plan to make my project highly collaborative among users. For example, if you and I attend the same university, share the same course with the same professor, then we can intertwine our planner. In doing so, as soon as I enter in a to-do in my planner for the same course we share, that to-do shall show up on your planner immediately if you accept or decline the new addition to your planner. This applies to creating events related to the same course as well. One of my goals is to make this easy for users to crowdsource their planners together.

I want to make my project very human-centered by allowing users to make post about their progress on PlanHacker on social medias, including Facebook, Twitter, and Linkedin. For example, a college student can make post on his or her completion of the finals on Facebook, "I am done with all my finals. I am finally free!!!" 

Another idea that I really want to pursue as I get further in my project is to create a sharing platform for users to overlap their schedules together so that friends can quickly figure out when are their available times to hang out by just looking at their meshed-up calenders. It sure beats the repetitive back-and-forth "Ok, you are not free at this time. So... Are you free at this time?"
